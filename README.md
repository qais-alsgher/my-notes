# key points that every developer must master.

## 1. Conceiving The Purpose of Software.
First of all, you should understand the purpose of the software. There is, in fact, a single purpose of all software: To help people.
## 2. The Goals of Software Design.
### Every programmer is a designer.
if you design a bad system, your software’s lifetime will be short.
## 3. (Mis)understanding
Developers who don’t fully understand their work tend to develop complex systems. It can become a vicious cycle: misunderstanding leads to complexity, which leads to further misunderstanding, and so on.
## 4. Simplicity
Programming is the act of reducing complexity to simplicity.
## 5. Complexity
The source of many software failures is complexity.
Your main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it.
## 6. Maintenance
Maintenance is one of the most important things in software development. Unfortunately, developers usually ignore how important it is.
All changes require maintenance.
**Simplicity** and **complexity** are the two main factors that affect code maintenance. The ease of maintenance of any piece of software is proportional to the simplicity of its individual pieces. The effort of maintenance is proportional to the complexity of the software.
## 7. Consistency
Code that isn’t consistent becomes harder to understand. Don’t keep forcing developers to relearn the way your system works every time they look at a new piece of it.

## 8. Prioritizing
there are three important factors that will help you make a better decision.

The desirability of a change (D): How much do you want that change to happen?
The value of a change (V): How much value does the change offer? How much does it help your users?
The effort required to perform the change (E): How much work will you need to do to accomplish this change?
The equation is simple: D=V/E

The changes that will bring you a lot of value and require little effort are better than those that will bring little value and require a lot of effort.

## 9. Solving Problems

### Think before acting.

The third step is dividing. Don’t try to solve one big problem. When you look at the problem as a whole, it can scare you. Divide it into smaller tasks and solve each sub-problem one by one. Once you solve each sub-problem, you connect the dots.

## 10. Good enough is fine

Whether creating a new project or adding a feature to existing system developers tend to plan everything out in detail from the beginning.

They want the first version to be perfect. They don’t focus on the problem they will solve and how their software will help people.

## 11. Predictions

“A prediction is simply a forecast that something will happen in the future. It could be factual and based on some kind of objective data or it could be based on an assumption.”

You can’t predict the future, so no matter how generic your solution is, it will not be generic enough to satisfy the actual future requirements you will have.

## 12. Assumptions
What is the assumption?

“An assumption is something that you accept as true or suppose to be true, although you have no conclusive proof.”
One of the great killers of a software project is assumptions.

To avoid being a victim like this developer, follow this simple rule:

Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future.

## 13. Stop Reinventing

The only times it’s okay to reinvent the wheel is when any of the following are true:

You need something that doesn’t exist yet
All of the existing “wheels” are bad technologies or incapable of handling your needs
The existing “wheels” aren’t being properly maintained

## 14. Resistance

As a developer, your first reaction to changing requests should be “NO’’.

Always resist adding more code, more features until you are convinced that they are required and there is a need to implement them. Because unnecessary changes will increase defects in your software.

## 15. Automation

Don’t spend your time on repetitive tasks. Set them up and forget about them. They can work while you are sleeping. When you realize that you are doing something again and again, just remember this rule:

If you can automate it, automate it.

## 16. Code measurement

Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.

The optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read.

## 17. Productivity

How do you measure your productivity?

By writing more lines of code or by throwing hundreds of lines of code away?!

Your main goal should be keeping your code base as small as possible. The question is not “How can I write more code?” rather it should be “How can I remove more code?”

## 18. Testing

When you have a bug, first you should reproduce it. You shouldn’t guess the source of the bug and apply fixes based on your assumption. Most probably, you will be wrong. You should see it with your own eyes before applying the fix.

You should be reliable. When other developers in your team see that you committed new code to source control, everyone should know that your code is tested, and works.

Untested code is the code that doesn’t work.

## 19. (Under)Estimation

Usually, they underestimate things rather than overestimate them. They underestimate the time and effort required to develop a small amount of code or a feature. In the end, this underestimation leads to missing deadlines.

The solution: Break the big thing into smaller things. The smaller it is, the easier it is to estimate. You’re probably still going to get it wrong, but you’ll be a lot less wrong than if you estimated a big project.

## 20. Running Away From Rewriting


Rewriting code is often a developer delusion, not the solution in most cases.

Why is it a delusion?

Well, because it’s harder to read code than to write it. This is why it is so hard to reuse code. This is why our subconscious mind whispers to us “Throw it away and start over” when we read another developer’s code.

There are many cases that you should consider to rewrite your code from scratch and you can read them here. But, here is simple advice for you:

### Refactoring should be the first option.

## 21. Documentation and Commenting

One of the common misconceptions about commenting is that developers add comments that say what code is doing. This is wrong. That should be obvious from reading the code. If it’s not obvious, it means that it is not readable and it should be made simpler.

When you can’t make the code simpler then you should add the comment to explain this complexity.

The real purpose of comments is to explain “WHY” you did something, not “WHAT” the code is doing. If you don’t explain this, other programmers may be confused and when they go to change your code they might remove important parts of it. – Code Simplicity
Write a comment to explain “WHY”, not to explain “WHAT”.

Another thing is documenting. It is important to have documentation to explain your software’s architecture and every module and components. This is required to see the high-level picture of your software.

When a new developer joins your team, it will be easier for them to understand the software as a whole. When developers don’t have any clue about other parts of the software, they could easily make a mistake in their own part which can affect other parts also.

## 22. Picking Technologies (Tools, Libraries, etc.)

Don’t depend on external technologies. But when you have to do so, try to reduce your dependency on them as much as you can.

When you are dependent so much on external technologies, you are not free. What if there is a major bug in that technology? You have to wait for the developers to fix that bug and if this technology is in the center of your project basically you are stuck, you can’t move forward. So that’s why it is so important to pick the right technologies for your project.

## 23. Self-Development 

Keep learning. Try out different programming languages and tools, read books on software development. They will give you another perspective. Every day small improvements will make a real difference in your knowledge and skills.

## 24. Don’t be a hero 
A lot of times it’s better to be a quitter than a hero

## 25. Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help

When you have something to implement and you are not sure about the solutions, don’t ask others how to so it …at least not immediately. Instead, try anything and everything you can think of. This is more important the less comfortable you are with a concept or language.

When you can’t think of anything on your own, search! Find answers and try them out. Modify those answers, see if you can understand why they work, adapt them to your code.

But always seek advice.
